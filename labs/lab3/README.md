Tusa Larkowski - Lab 3 (JavaScript)
========================================
For part 1 I chose to use a symbol other than '-' for the output - and in part 2 I created my own dialogue box to show up on the page (and created a div at the top of the <body> to do so.

(CLICK TWICE TO PERFORM ACTION) For part 2, I added my own custom dialogue box and changed the condition for pulling it up from clicking the element to double clicking. 

For part 3, I chose to clone the first "quote" element and leave it at that. In addition, instead of adding padding solely to one side I added it to both to keep up aesthetics for overall page design.

(Files created by me include this README, lab3.js, and lab3.css - plus the additional HTML added to create personal dialogue box.)
