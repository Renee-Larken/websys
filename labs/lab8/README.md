* Sorry this submission is really late. The conference I was away at kept me busier than I expected and I had a lot of work to catch up on when I got back. I also didn't copy down all the commands I used, and need to move on to other work so wouldn't be able to re-write all the MySQL code I used. So I'll take the lowered points for that.
