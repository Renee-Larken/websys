=============================================

Part 1:

	I chose to arrange my song choices in a list as, logically, they are a list themselves (semantically accurate depiction). From there, I made them inline elements so they appeared in a 2x3 grid under the title. (I also chose to make the album image the link to the page on AllMusic.com.)

Part 2:

	For the XML document, I decided to again follow a list sort of format. For specific tags, since this is a list of favorites, I chose favSongs as the encompassing descriptor. Each song entry within that is denoted by the <song> tag, with the album image, title, and link located one branch further under my <album> tag (for the sake of organization) and the separation of multiple genres into multiple <genre> tags.

Part 3:
	
	For the third section, I went again with the HTML list option and moved the CSS previously hosted in the header to a separate style sheet. This effect increased readability in my HTML file. (I also chose to change around some of the style instructions in suiting my previously established style.)

Part 4:
	
	Didn't have enough time to style this as I wanted to, but it's my final end product.
