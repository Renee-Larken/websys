               Lab 7  :  Tusa Larkowski
========================================================

* While the resources being used are actually all located in my general Resource folder, I also included copies of their full directories in this Lab 7 folder.

* I chose to switch from using XML files that were required in the quiz to JSON files for ease of development on my end.

* I changed all served HTML files to PHP to allow for usage of PHP includes for elements found similarly across all pages.
