			<p>Hello there! This is the website of a Lark - where you can find some Web Sys labs and 1 or 2 homeworks for the course.</p>
			<p>For your convenience, there's a nice little navigation bar up top that'll take you a list of these files. Under <em>Labs</em> you'll find - yes, very surprisingly - some labwork. <em>Homeworks</em> will give you the list of homework assignments (there are 2).</p>
