Tusa Larkowski - Web Sys - Homework 1
============================================

1) I used strict XHTML as it seemed to fit more with an online resume (professional setting requires as few errors as possible, and strict XHTML needs to be formatted correctly to run).
2) I think my choice compares to others in that it is stricter on its rules. For example, all tag names need to be lowercase - something you won't encounter in regular HTML. But all of the limitations are good tools for creating a better coding practice.
3) For the most part, I used all of the tags as they seemed to make sense on such a small scale (a little table with my different types of address, unordered lists to create bullet points where appropriate in the info section). I used the <span> at a couple of points, however, so I had room to keep the theme running throughout the page on the contact tag line.
4) The hCard information is great for browsers as they can be set up to widely recognize the microformatting across different webpages and add default styling/perform appropriate actions. User-wise, they can be quickly recognized and used or manipulated to suit their end needs (as well as adding semantic details to information).

*side note -> instead of adding a personal image of myself, I styled it to have a sort of image bookmark that I was told would be alright for the final product.
